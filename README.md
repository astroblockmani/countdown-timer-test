# Assumptions and Notes

Minimal styling / no focus on styling as not stated in test spec. Can add this if required.

Hard coded 'date to countdown'. Otherwise could look to pass in user value. Happy to implement if required.

Accounted for days/hours/mins/seconds as no units so timer specified in test spec. Can refactor if you wish to only display mins/secs etc, for example.
